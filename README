This java library is a "tutorial" for Haskell iteratees[1].

This was written mainly to understand how iteratees work. They seem to have
very many complex interactions. And it is shared here only in the hope that
some one who knew java but does not understand iteratees will be able to go
through the code and Oleg's notes of his talk[2] as well as haskell enumerator
library[3].



Structure of the source
There are three packages
a. haskell.data.enumerator
   This is the main package. It provides interfaces and classes that *look
   like* the corresponding data types in haskell (Data.Enumerator.Internal
   module of [3])
b. haskell.data.enumerator.ex
   This package provides most of the examples from [2]
   
c. haskell.data.utils
   This package defines some utility classes and interfaces (like functions
   etc). This package is relatively unimportant and is only tangential to the
   main  topic. 
   The interfaces are so designed that they can simulate 'lazy'
   evaluation. However not much thought has been put into these.


How to use it:

mvn install
mvn javadoc:javadoc
